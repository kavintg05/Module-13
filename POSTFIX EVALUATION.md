# Exp.No:33  
## POSTFIX EVALUATION

---

### AIM  
To write a Python program to evaluate a user-given Postfix expression that contains Multiplication and Addition operators using the stack concept.

---

### ALGORITHM

1. **Start the program.**
2. Define a set named `OPERATORS` containing all the valid operators: `*, +, **, -, /, %`.
3. Define a function `evaluate_postfix(exp)` to evaluate the postfix expression:
   - Inside the function, create an empty list called `stack` to store operands and intermediate results.
4. Loop through each item in the given postfix expression:
   - If the current item is **not in OPERATORS**, it is an operand, so append it to the stack.
   - If the current item is an **operator**:
     - Pop the top two elements from the stack (first pop is `a`, second pop is `b`).
     - Perform the operation `b <operator> a` depending on the current operator.
     - Store the result in a variable called `result`.
     - Append the result back to the stack.
5. After the loop ends, return the first element of the stack as the final evaluation result.
6. Take a postfix expression as input from the user.
7. Print the postfix expression.
8. Call the function `evaluate_postfix()` with the input and print the result.
9. **End the program.**

#Name-Kavindra T G
OPERATORS = {'*', '+', '**', '-', '/', '%'}

def evaluate_postfix(exp):
    stack = []
    for token in exp.split():
        if token not in OPERATORS:
            stack.append(int(token))
        else:
            a = stack.pop()
            b = stack.pop()
            if token == '+':
                result = b + a
            elif token == '*':
                result = b * a
            elif token == '-':
                result = b - a
            elif token == '/':
                result = b / a
            elif token == '%':
                result = b % a
            elif token == '**':
                result = b ** a
            stack.append(result)
    return stack[0]

postfix_input = input("Enter postfix expression (e.g., '3 4 + 2 *'): ")
print("Postfix Expression:", postfix_input)
print("Evaluated Result:", evaluate_postfix(postfix_input))
